## 📁 Project Structure

The code is organized into several main components:
- `robostrategy_yoni.m` – the main strategy function used by the robot
- Helper functions that handle:
  - Fuel station selection
  - Mine and trap avoidance
  - Opponent behavior analysis
  - Basic pathfinding and fallback logic

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open MATLAB
2. Make sure all files are in the same folder
3. Set `robostrategy_yoni` as the robot’s strategy function in the competition environment
4. Run the game – the robot will act automatically using its strategy
